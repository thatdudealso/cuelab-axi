# CueLab-axi

CueLab-axi is the standalone local human interface for BeatForge. It is a
separate repo, styled as a turntable/deck, and backed by the same BeatForge
operations that agents use through `beatforge-axi`.

The deck is live. The UI now supports real generate, play, and export flows.
This README defines the current controls, the integration boundary, and the
contribution expectations for the deck experience.

## Product shape

CueLab should open directly into the usable music workspace. It is not a landing
page and should not explain itself on screen. The first screen should make the
track, prompt, deck state, and export path visible immediately.

Primary modes:

- Easy mode: prompt box, duration, preset style controls, engine selector,
  generate button, play take, and export controls.
- Advanced mode: waveform-on-platter view, section repaint tool, remix controls,
  stem mixer, loop-point editor, analysis panel, and job history.

The interface must gate controls by engine capability. If the active engine does
not support repaint, remix, stems, or analysis, the related controls should be
disabled with a concise reason from the engine descriptor.

## Integration boundary

CueLab does not shell out from the browser. It talks to the local BeatForge
runtime served by `beatforge-axi serve`.

Target routes are versioned under `/v1` and mirror the operation manifest:

| CueLab control | Operation | Route |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prompt deck | `generate` | `/v1/jobs/generate` |
| Waveform repaint region | `repaint` | `/v1/jobs/repaint` |
| Remix style controls | `remix` | `/v1/jobs/remix` |
| Stem mixer | `stems` | `/v1/jobs/stems` |
| Track analysis panel | `analyze` | `/v1/jobs/analyze` |
| Play take | `play` | local artifact URL |
| Export take | `export` | local artifact URL |

Long-running operations create jobs and are polled through the local BeatForge
API until they reach a terminal state. The same operation service backs the CLI
and the UI so the two surfaces cannot drift.

## Expected workflows

Easy generation:

1. Choose an engine or keep the configured default.
2. Enter a prompt and duration.
3. Generate a take.
4. Play the take in place or export MP3/WAV.

Advanced editing:

1. Load a generated or imported track.
2. Select a section on the platter waveform.
3. Repaint the section when the engine supports it.
4. Adjust loop points and crossfade boundaries.
5. Split stems or remix when available.
6. Export the final audio file and operation metadata.

## Design principles

- Build the actual deck as the app, not a marketing wrapper.
- Keep layout dense, calm, and useful for repeated editing.
- Use engine capability data to drive visible states.
- Keep controls stable so generated labels, progress, and errors do not resize
  the workspace.
- Use icons for deck tools where available and include hover tooltips.
- Verify desktop and mobile layouts with screenshots before merging UI changes.
- Do not hide missing engine support behind fake controls.

## Repository model

- This repo is the standalone CueLab front door, not a subdirectory of
  `beatforge-axi`.
- Keep UI, build, and browser-test changes here.
- Keep engine contracts, job runtime, and server changes in `beatforge-axi`.
- Review CueLab changes as their own PR against this repo's `main` branch.

## Planned implementation

Expected stack:

- React and TypeScript
- Vite
- pnpm
- local BeatForge API client generated or derived from the operation manifest
- Playwright for end-to-end UI workflows
- screenshot checks for desktop and mobile deck layouts

This repo should avoid duplicating BeatForge engine rules. Engine support,
warnings, artifact metadata, and job progress come from the local API.

## Testing expectations

CueLab changes should include:

- Playwright coverage for easy generation with the real synth engine;
- capability-gating tests for repaint, remix, stems, and analysis;
- cancellation, polling, and timeout behavior;
- export flow coverage;
- desktop and mobile screenshots reviewed for overlap, clipping, blank canvas
  states, and text overflow.

Hardware model inference is not required for ordinary UI CI. The real synth
engine should exercise the same API contracts, while fake remains confined to
contract tests.

## Current status

CueLab has a React/Vite deck that targets the local BeatForge `/v1` API
boundary. The current pass covers real generate/play/export behavior, visible
transport controls, and capability-gated advanced tools. Remaining work is
progress streaming, broader Playwright coverage, and browser screenshot review
for the advanced mode.
